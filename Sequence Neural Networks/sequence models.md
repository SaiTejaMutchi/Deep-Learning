# Sequence Models
- Sequence models are the machine learning models that input or output sequences of data.
- Sequence Models like RNN and LSTMs have greatly transformed learning on sequences in the past few years.
- **Transfer Learning:**
Transfer learning (TL) is a research problem in machine learning (ML) that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. For example, knowledge gained while learning to recognize cars could apply when trying to recognize trucks.
- Examples of sequence data in applications:
  - Speech recognition (sequence to sequence):
    - X: wave sequence
    - Y: text sequence
  - Sentiment classification (sequence to one):
    - X: text sequence
    - Y: integer rating from one to five
  - Music generation (one to sequence):
    - X: nothing or an integer
    - Y: wave sequence
